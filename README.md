# memoryGame
# How It's Made:
Here is a fun little game of memory. I used a method for shuffling by pushing sections into an array and then pulling that array and placing into random sections. Afterward the user can click on each box and flip the card to hopefully match them all and then get a Game Over alert signifying the win.

# Tech used: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript


# Lessons Learned:
I learned about about event listeners and creating a game with a card shuffling method.
